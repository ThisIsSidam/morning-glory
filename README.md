# Morning Glory

A minimalist alarm app that I made according to my own personal needs of having trouble waking up, needing to quickly setup nap alarms and more. The features may not be your cup of tea but that's for you to decide.

## ✨ Features

* **🌙 Two Dedicated Alarms:** Simplicity is key. The app features two persistent alarms:
    * **Sleep:** For your main nightly rest.
    * **Nap:** For short power naps during the day.
    * *No new alarms can be created, reducing clutter and promoting a consistent sleep schedule.*

* **🎵 Custom Ringtones:** Wake up to the sounds you love. The sounds are imported from Android Setting's ringtone picker, so you can import those and your own ones if they are there.

* **🔐 QR Code Lock:** For the heavy sleepers! To dismiss an alarm, you must scan a pre-selected QR code. Place the QR code in another room (like your kitchen or bathroom) to force yourself out of bed.

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

* **🔀 Random Ringtone:** A feature to randomly select a ringtone from your imported list for each alarm, so you don't destroy your loved song or get bored out of one!
* **🖼️ Custom Alarm Screen Image:** Personalize your wake-up screen by adding your own image. See a picture of your pet, a loved one, or something to motivate you to wake up.
* **💳 NFC locks:** Another way to lock the dismiss button by having to tap an NFC tag. Similar but more convinient than QR code locks. 

## Extra

I had also added this feature called 'Follow-up Notification'. A certain time after the alarm, a notification would be sent to check whether the user is awake or not, if not dismissed, it would setup the alarm again. It was for times a person goes back to sleep after dismissing the alarm. Although I removed it because it gave the user a thought that the follow-up would wake them, leading them to have less resistence in falling back to sleep.
